    <p>Kenneth and I got to spend more quality time together this weekend. We took Crusher for a couple walks and inspected the bark of nearly every tree along the way. Crusher does not mind the slowness involved with bark inspection since he’s usually on the hunt for the next smell to track down. The weather was really nice this weekend, so I didn’t mind the slow stroll with the boys.</p>

<p>When inside, we played a lot of music!</p>

<p>Rachel and I recently watched Cooked, the documentary based on the book by Michael Pollan. It was a great series and I was especially drawn to the part where he makes his own bread. We looked up a few recipes and started making our own sourdough starter last weekend and this weekend got to start making the bread. The loaves turned out well enough that they could pass for bread, but not quite sourdough. I think the starter has to grow a bit more. It was fun making the bread and trying to improve on each loaf as I created it. More to come here, I’m sure.</p>

<p>I started watching the talks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGuKhcnrqGA&amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY">React.js Conf 2016</a> this weekend and am pretty excited about the upcoming possibilities with React. I am especially excited about the “learn once, write anywhere” ideas behind the framework as it grows beyond just the web browser.</p>

<p>Finally, we trekked into the city today to visit friends in the hospital that just had a baby. It was fun to be back at the same hospital where Ken was born and think back to when we started our life with him.</p>
