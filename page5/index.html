    <p>I was fortunate to attend a friend's bachelor party at Yankee Stadium and even though the Yankees lost, it was still a fun way to send Matt off. For the game we had a suite on the first base with more than enough room and food for us.</p>
<p>We got the stadium around noon and settled in.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/8fd21b1900b0869c0ec0cb8ca791a56756d8b291e9e5075554080badd204a1a1.jpg"></p>

<p>Around the start of the game, a couple of Yankees historians game by to show and let us hold a few historical objects. We got to see a game-worn jersey from Jeter's 3,000th hit game (apparently he quite a few that day), home plate from the last game at the old stadium and first at the new one, a bat signed and used by Mickey Mantle in the 1958 World Series, and a couple recent World Series rings.</p>

<p>The game, itself, didn't go to well for the Yankees, but I still had a great time.</p>

    <p>I had so much fun taking pictures on my run last weekend, I decided to give it another try yesterday. I had a twelve mile run on the calendar and decided to run over the Brooklyn Bridge and then up the West Side Highway a couple miles, then turn around and come home. </p>
<p>As with all runs, I eagerly await my watch to sync up with the satellites.</p>
<p><img src="/images/33e775b1832e6efb6191ee83870b9cca1d4866e2d4b144b565f0fcaeeaf6ccbe.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>I got an early start and had the roads to myself.</p>
<p><img src="/images/29a83be9a6336ecd1d94cf5ee29dc5ea1b5a88fed4b964b352eda29f5c0e9fa9.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<p>There was a lot of car traffic leading up to the bridge, since it was closed to cars into Manhattan, but the path for bikes and pedestrians was pretty quiet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/39c43490435518d53f32b8f2369ffb8d21f9cb5c2ccd1fe4485fe8bcc9d19430.jpg"></p>

<p>After coming off the bridge, I headed west for a couple more miles.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fc1c430c5bb610e7388877529617707a8b042c9449a381eed2f76c1cc2b5f58.jpg"></p>

<p>I then turned around and headed back toward the World Trade Center.</p>
<p><img src="/images/8537ed47a45724143ec563c70de17f18664baceae729e67d6c982e559543d18d.jpg"></p>
<p>Remember how crowded the Manhattan side of the bridge was last weekend. Thanks to the earlier start this week, it wasn't too bad at all.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cc854674fa808119ed81f846c0dd9dffa48257a1fafd071fa918857c0a04fbcf.jpg"></p>
<p>With that, I put the phone away and knocked out a couple more miles at marathon pace and then cooled down the rest of the way home. </p>
<p>Once home, Rachel and I went to get some breakfast and then I headed out to Yankee Stadium for the afternoon game.</p>

    <p>I went for a run this morning and since it was a beautiful day, I decided to take a few pictures. </p>
<p>Starting off the run on our quiet street. al di la has already cleaned the sidewalks, but nothing else is happening.</p>
<p><img src="/images/62da0734f1f1734526b9b3bc5fc1583dcaadde44f6ea20e4cb0502d5a214696a.jpg"></p>
<p>I ran across to Columbia st. to catch the bike bath and make my way up toward Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>
<p><img src="/images/5b3bb4af87237c782db5292a8d17cfd27630743e082f2410bef3319eff3a9f3c.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<p>I think this is Pier 5, which has lots of soccer fields.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c9af47357f16b89440310aa29ecb5b9ebcb5b23bb2df2ed4e54e9e9f0186c591.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<p>I took the new path and headed toward the brand new Pier 2.</p>
<p><img src="/images/4d773dccbe1ea5b2c8deb4b172009cff8a495574243d1198f8e24777ac8deff8.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pier 2, the new fitness pier.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2c80424a11d66f0ed0437da024c9a9b4a2747395d7a5437b33a27631e3ba9da2.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Got back to the main path and had my first good view of the bridge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/45b6a02770e32d104e8f9cda39aa1e9b07a1564d6e20b6298b36db3e9b23e115.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<p>I made it down to Pier 1 and took a quick stop for some photos of Manhattan and bridges.</p>
<p><img src="/images/e946ffdfb568d673e4043be1643380463b38f776fbfa5ee5f2444507a2e14fb6.jpg"></p>

<p>I then headed under the Brooklyn Bridge and over to the carousel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/a59268e39beaa0723ea88d7c01d9486cbfb45c491d43526f8c3ecca5f702d910.jpg"></p>

<p>That's obviously me in the reflection.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c57b24f9dbe5845eb20fe4a871108935ace0c79a7a67da3a64b3b30bc8fe65a2.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<p>Looks like there was going to be a viewing party here later, my guess is the World Cup.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c71955cf38ddb82a5ba62f12cb67872b4103f7d6e841dc5e915b32749dd1d31e.jpg"></p>
<p>Just a street scene from Dumbo. We don't come over here often, but it looks like somewhere we should return to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/54fc8a672a3c9fcdc9ed7205e40ecd667850a688448c76fe092839a2bc938951.jpg"></p>
<p>I made my way back to the entrance of the Manhattan Bridge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/87dcdeb28afb8349ca29c78f453d34d1c40c7c556fa2e0abd3eda8099d88ef93.jpg"></p>
<p>Climbing the bridge.</p>

<p>My favorite view in the entire city.</p>
<p><img src="/images/11e2a03af9f3b43171cf20a4530f36b535a1242478e93d3255f237df89de2fca.jpg"></p>

<p>This cop tried to hit me as he rolled through a stop sign. I stared him down, kept running, then snapped this as he passed. I made sure to wait for the walk sign before running through the next light, though.</p>

<p>Look at all those people. I guess I didn't make it to the bridge early enough. Lots of dodging people and bikes for the mile and a half.</p>

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Over the last few months our TV started getting harder and harder to watch. Every couple minutes the picture would go out for anywhere from a second to about fifteen. I started playing around with various settings and figured out it was actually our <a href="http://www.onkyousa.com/Products/model.php?m=TX-SR606&amp;class=Receiver">Oknyo TX-SR606 HDMI receiver</a> that was causing the problems. After doing a quick search, I learned this was a common problem for the receiver and a relatively easy fix (if you are comfortable with a soldering iron).</p>
<p>I found this helpful video on YouTube and watched it a couple times to get familiar with what I needed to do.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1GgDEtSug2o" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>The problem with the receiver was five capacitors that needed to be replaced. I ordered the parts and they arrived on Friday.</p>
<p>When I started out with the project I was optimistic I could fix the hdim board, but was not certain. The work to remove the old capacitors sounded delicate and I am quite out of practice with a soldering iron. But today was as good as any to either fix or break our receiver.</p>
<p>Below are the new capacitors along with the invoice. Shipping cost more than the actual parts I needed to replace on the board.</p>
<p><img src="/images/5abaa006844e58aac4b202c15ba345d3fb76d5c9fbcf7a4566811a44b8f76171.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>I unplugged the receiver and took it over to the kitchen table, which would server as my makeshift lab.</p>
<p><img src="/images/60e881e6f47c7828c04196d9cf62b763ff8dff12757ba7976d565065703c6e25.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>I got to work taking off the cover then unplugging and removing the hdmi card.</p>
<p><img src="/images/4437d4c70d89a86edd384c7396be7144b1fc2628cbb50e528c13a9dda4e6de1e.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/ca2a90066a20b4af07b254c7e4e19adfad3a56df281668c046a94d122f89ff52.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/a23aa8c5efca7176ad458716f7c28ec07b9c25529626acc87de170ec4dff39f4.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the card was out, I started gently removing the faulty capacitors. I removed them by using a pair of pliers to gently twist each capacitor until their legs broke off.</p>
<p><img src="/images/8e3c484cc64e8e7c34db7bfd1edb8b8764b6082f8ec9324b57350b79e649c8ec.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, I started soldering. It didn't go perfectly smooth, but Rachel helped me hold the new capacitors in place and by the time I finished putting the fifth capacitor in place I felt comfortable with the soldering iron. We used Rachel's kneaded eraser to hold the capacitors in place as I soldered them to the board.</p>
<p><img src="/images/111e6b5576cf607cff59ef85859bf089dd5e4dc8289f37b28a5f4a66724619b5.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the picture above, look for the long, black capacitors that say "10V 100uF" in the bottom of the picture. Those are two of the five capacitors that I added. </p>
<p>With cleanup complete, I just had to put everything back together and then test it out.</p>
<p>I'll save all the drama and suspense and just say that my project worked! I plugged everything back in, turned everything on and was able to successfully see a picture on the screen. I then enabled a few configurations that the receiver could previously not handle and they worked. Finally, I watched TV for about 15 minutes without a single flicker and declared victory.</p>
<p>Even though the receiver is about seven years old, I didn't find myself in need of a new one. The features that have been added to the newer Onkyo receivers aren't very enticing, so I couldn't be happier that I was able to salvage this device all for $1.62.</p>

    <p>For our last full day in Paris we decided to go to the Orsay Museum and then to Notre Dame Cathedral. We got a late start and when we got to the Orsay, the line was way too long. We had the Paris Museum Pass and had priority access, but even with that, the line snaked all over the place. We decided to cut our losses and just walk around, get lunch and eventually head over to Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Lunch was fun and we checked a few shopping items off Rachel's list, but when we got over to Notre Dame the line was also longer than we wanted to wait in. We've been in a lot of cathedrals over the last four weeks and spending hours in a line to see another was not how we wanted to spend our last day. Instead, we got ice cream and then headed back over to the Orsay.</p>
<p>The Orsay had a much shorter line than earlier in the day and we got in after about twenty minutes. The museum is known for their impressionist and post-impressionist collections. There were plenty of great paintings to see, but I loved the building - an old train station - the most. It was a great setting for a museum.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cfc56e811128e9bb99499aae2ddd2554b955573f4705e7018a68c8f5bba1c0d4.jpg"></p>

<p></p>
<p>And that's it. We've made it to Day 29 of our trip. We head to the airport in about an hour and start our trek home. </p>
<p>See you soon.</p>

    <p>Today was a bit rainy and almost everything was closed due to May Day, but still had a great day. In the morning we headed out to Versailles to walk the grounds. We couldn't go in anything, but we could walk all over the gardens, so we covered as much ground as we could. I didn't mind not getting into the palace since we've seen quite a few this trip and didn't get to walk around in the impressive Schönbrunn Palace gardens. </p>

<p></p>
<p>In the evening we headed over to the Eiffel Tower and made a stop at each level - including a stop on the first level for dinner. Dinner was even more fun than I expected and running around the tower in the rain with Rachel was a blast.</p>

<p>Today's our last full day of the trip. We're going to the <a href="http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html">Orsay Museum</a> and then to Notre Dame. We also plan to find and eat as many treats as possible.</p>

    <p>We've made it to our final destination, Paris. I have been looking forward to this stop the entire time and our first day out did not disappoint at all.</p>
<p>We have three full days here, so on the first day we decided to go the the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>We got an early start after breakfast at the hotel and took the metro to the Louvre. We first headed to the Italian painters section (since we didn't get enough of them in Italy) to fight the crowds and see Mona Lisa. Next, we headed to the French painters section. My favorite from this section was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coronation_of_Napoleon">The Coronation of Napolean</a>, though I was certain I'd already seen this same one somewhere else on our trip.</p>
<p>Our next destination was the Arc de Triomphe with a few stops along the way. We first headed to <a href="http://www.angelina-paris.fr/">Angelina</a></p>
<p></p>
<p> for hot chocolate and then walked down <span>The Avenue des </span><span>Champs</span><span>-</span><span>Élysées for some window shopping. </span></p>
<p><span>We finally made it to the Arc de Triomphe and climbed to the top some impressive views of the area.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we headed back to the hotel, found a great place to eat then called it a day.</span></p>

<p><span>Today we are going to walk around the Palace of Versailles. Today is May Day, which means many museums are closed, and the Palace is actually closed too, but we are going to walk around the garden and see the grounds.</span></p>

    <p>After our great stay in Varenna, we headed to Lausanne, Switzerland for two nights. It ended up pretty cloudy and rainy, so we didn't get to see the Alps like I was hoping, but we had a relaxing time. We didn't do too much sightseeing, but we did walk around the town a bit as we searched out food and it looked comfortable (and pricey).</p>
<p>The highlights of Lausanne for me were getting a real Swiss dinner with heavy cheese fondue for dinner and relaxing with Rachel watching whatever show was on the English language television station.</p>
<p>Also, we came across a French show called Taxi Brooklyn that seemed to be on nonstop across a few different stations, but although it was filmed in English, it had been dubbed over in French. </p>
<p>I didn't take many pictures in Lausanne, but have made up for it now that we have made it to Paris. More to come soon.</p>

    <p>In my post about Varenna I accidentally left out one event that both horrified me and still has us laughing when we think about it.</p>
<p>One thing that is different with the hotels we have stayed at than ones I have stayed at before is that the hotel usually put the key on a big, heavy key ring and asks that leave the key at the front desk when you go out. The one difference with our hotel in Varenna was that the front desk closed at midnight, so if you wanted to stay out later, you had to take a bunch of different keys with you to get into the hotel and then into your room.</p>
<p>Also, it was warmer than usual in Varenna and the hotel had not yet turned on the air conditioning. It mostly got hot in the afternoon as the sun shone into our room, but we could open the doors to the balcony after the sun went down and got a nice, cooling breeze.</p>
<p>On our second night, we decided to sleep with the door open since it was still pretty warm in our room. At around 1:00 am, we woke up with someone trying to get into our room. I woke up before they got in, as they were starting to peak their head around the curtains blocking the open doorway, and yelled at them to get out of the room and go away.</p>
<p>It turns out that the other family staying at the hotel did not bring their keys with them and stayed out later than they were expecting. They got locked out, saw our open door and did not know it was a room so they tried to enter the hotel through our doorway.</p>
<p>Needless to say. we kept our doors shut the rest of the time we slept in Varenna.</p>

    <p>The next stop on our trip was Varenna, a small town in northern Italy on Lake Como. After a few weeks of busy cities and lots of museums we decided we needed a change of pace. Varenna was a perfect spot to recharge. </p>
<p>After taking the train to Varenna, we had about a mile hike with our bags uphill to our hotel. It was hot, but when we made it to our room and walked out onto our balcony the view made it all worth it. </p>

<p>On Friday we went for a hike and found another castle and a waterfall. This castle was cool because they had a small falconry and brought the birds out for us to see. The waterfall was cool because it was runoff from the snowy Italian Alps.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/fb3c1e3ab33416399e52f18c122bbd4d82829b1e81032692c8a6fba7966f6127.jpg"></p>

<p>For our last full day on Lake Como we decided to take the boat over to Bellagio. Bellagio was nice, with more shopping and more people than Varenna, but not much else. We explored a bit and got some gelatto, then we caught the boat back to Varenna.</p>

<p>And with that, we are on the train to Switzerland. We are heading to Lausanne today and going to spend two nights eating fondue and checking out the Alps.</p>

    <p>Today we took full advantage of our Firenze Card and started the day off with a trip to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffizi">Uffizi Gallery</a>. The Uffizi is said to have the greatest collection of Italian painters anywhere. The highlight for me was the room full of Botticelli paintings. Other than that, I didn't really enjoy it. Many works were hard to see because of the odd viewing areas through the transoms. </p>
<p>After lunch we did some much-needed laundry and set out for T<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_dell%27Accademia">he Accademia</a>. I didn't know anything about this museum except that Michelangelo's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)">David</a> was here. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/nIxqJCi0Az/">David</a> was more impressive than I expected. We've seen a lot of sculpture over the last few weeks, but David was, better than anything else we've seen. It was the combination of size (we overheard an amateur tour guide claim he was 17' 1") and clean finish that impressed me the most. Other than David, the gallery didn't have much that captured my interest.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head to Varenna on Lake Como for a couple days of relaxation and hiking. Before we leave Florence, we are going to get a little more use out of our cards and climb to the top of the bell tower and visit the Duomo Museum.</p>
<p>I didn't take as many pictures today, but really like this one of Rachel from the roof garden at the Uffizi with the Duomo in the background.</p>

    <p>Yesterday we left Rome and arrived in Florence. To maximize our time in Florence, we decided to get the Firenze Card, which gives us access to most museums and lets us wait in the priority lines, which usually move very fast. </p>
<p>We made quick use of the card by first climbing to the top of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral">Duomo</a> and were rewarded with amazing views in all directions. Once we got to the top, we got to spend as much time as we wanted looking out over Florence. Coming down was fun as we had to negotiate the small staircases and free space with people coming up.</p>
<p>After the Duomo we set out to find dinner and followed dinner up with some gelato recommended to us by a friend.</p>

		<h1 class="post-title" itemprop="name headline"><a href="/fourweeks/2014/04/22/napoli.html">Napoli</a></h1>

    <p>We took a day trip to Naples before leaving Rome. It was only about an hour train ride on the high speed train. I wasn't sure what to expect, but did know to expect it to be a bit more intense than Rome. And it definitely was. We got off the train and went straight for pizza at <a href="http://www.damichele.net/">L' Antica Pizzeria da Michele</a>. The pizza was some of the best I've ever had. It was just a margherita, but the sauce, cheese and crust were all perfect. We were seated with a couple of locals that sort of spoke English (much better than our Italian) and had a good time chatting with them about Naples.</p>
<p>We then went to the National Archeological Museum and roamed the halls for a couple hours. They have a bunch of stuff from Pompeii and it is really interesting to see their art and everyday tools, but since they have so much it all starts to look the same after a while. I was most impressed with their baking ware and dishes. They looked much more advanced than I would have expected for nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>We then decided to try and find a beach or at least see the water, so we wandered in that general direction for a bit. Along the way we walked through the Umberto the Ist Gallery. It seems like at one time the gallery was an impressive shopping center, but today it just feels like a massive, abandoned structure with people selling fake handbags and scarves in the middle. We tried a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfogliatelle">sfogliatelle</a> and I found it to be about as good as I thought <span>sweetened ricotta </span><span>cheese in a pastry would taste.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we finally made it to the water, we took in a clear view of Mount Vesuvius, snapped a few pictures and headed back to the train station. I was ready to leave Naples. The food was great, but the city was more intense and busy that I liked.</span></p>

<p>We got back to Rome and got ready for our trip to Florence. More on that soon.</p>
<p>We originally planned to go to Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland at the end of this week, but started looking at the weather recently and saw that it was going to be in the teens and 100% chance of snow. We packed as light as we could for this trip, which meant my snow coat didn't make the cut. As a result, we cancelled our hotel in Lauterbrunnen and are looking for an alternative. We are thinking about heading toward Lake Geneva in Switzerland, maybe staying in Lausanne, but are open to recommendations. We really want to stay in Switzerland and be as close to the Alps as possible, but still be warm enough to go out and hike. If you have any suggestions, please let us know. Thanks.</p>
