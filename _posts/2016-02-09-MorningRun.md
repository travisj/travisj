I was feel really good on this run, but I must have overdid it. Everything felt strong until I reach the six mile mark and my knee started feeling terrible. My IT Band seemed to be moving all over the place and when I made it home and walked up the stairs, I could tell I was in trouble due to the pain.

I tried resting for nearly two weeks and was still not any better.
