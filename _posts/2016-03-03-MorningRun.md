First run after my right knee injury so I took it easy for the first two miles. At that point, I changed the pace up to a tempo run to see how things felt. I actually felt better at the faster speed. Overall, my knee does not feel as healed as I would like. I am not experiencing any pain, but it feels a bit more sore than ideal. I plan to rest tomorrow and see how things feel this weekend for a five to eight mile run.
