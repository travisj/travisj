Fairly dissapointing run. I've been having knee pain, which is why I have been resting it and not running, and I could tell pretty early on that it was not gone. I had hopes of running 12 miles tomorrow, but I think it is best for me to rest it for another week. I have the Paris Marathon coming up in three weeks and given my complete lack of training, a couple more runs here or there is not going to make a difference. The only thing I can hope for now is that I show up to the start line as healthy as possible.
