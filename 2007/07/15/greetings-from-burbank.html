    <p>On Thursday it became official, I now work for <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> To kick off the old job with the new company, I’m spending some time in Burbank for meetings. Rather than go home for the weekend I decided to stick around and have some fun. Today I went to Disneyland and it was outrageous. I went with Brad, Pat and his family. We didn’t have to wait in a line over 30 minutes. We knocked out all the good rides at Disneyland by early afternoon then went over to California Adventures. I hadn’t been there before and was fairly impressed. I like Disneyland better, but California Adventures had some pretty good rides. My favorite was definitely California Screamin’ - we rode it three times.</p>
<p>I’ve got a few other plans for things to do before heading home. Tomorrow I’m heading south to visit my family in Orange County. I think I’ll try and have dinner with a few friends that have moved here in the last few years. And, as luck would have it, <a href="http://www.ryan-adams.com">Ryan Adams</a> is playing <a href="http://www.wtbh.org/index.html">The Wilshire Theatre</a> on Thursday. It appears that they show might be sold out, but I’m still going to try to figure out how to get some tickets.</p>
<p>I have also been talking to Rachel just about every night and she is having a great time. In fact, she has modified her trip a little and is now going to Greece for about five days after her program ends. This means she won’t get in to Kansas City until late on July 25th (for anyone that cares).</p>
<p>I’m guessing by the silence on my last post, that no one has taken the time to watch <a href="http://www.clarkandmichael.com">Clark and Michael</a>. Shame on you. Just watch the webisodes, they are short and amazing.</p>
