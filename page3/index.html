    <p>I ran the Vienna City Marathon today and Rachel was an amazing supporter. The race was fine and I got right about what I was expecting and hoping for. I'll run more later, but for the rest of our time in Europe (three more weeks!) we can just focus on eating and sightseeing at each stop.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/4f17fe6d1484e466d58c5fa4c0a12a6a4d490a3375f99b1f17f95664542ec45d.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>I enjoyed everything about the marathon today, but it was hard. I got to sleep in a lot, relative to other races I've done since the marathon didn't start until 9am. We left the place we are staying around 7:15 and headed to Jamse's hotel right by the start to wait in warmth. The race, itself, was a bit chaotic. There were people everywhere. Walking to bag drop took forever, getting back to our starting corals took forever. There were many spots around the course that were not wide enough to support the number of runners, which made for more dodging, weaving and even some stopping than I would have liked. This was my first race to not have mile markers and instead have kilometer markers which kept things fun converting remaining distances on the fly. This all made for a fun and interesting race.</p>
<p>I was a bit too ambitious last night when I thought we could do some more sightseeing after the race. Surprisingly, I am too tired. I'm resting, Rachel is doing some laundry for us and we'll get some dinner with our friends I ran the marathon with tonight.</p>
<p>We're still making plans for tomorrow, but we are here until our overnight train to Venice leaves at about 9:00pm. I am really hoping to ride the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringstra%C3%9Fe">Ringstraße</a> and then see some combination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere,_Vienna">Belvedere Palace/Art Museum</a>, and maybe back to Schönbrunn Palace to tour the gardens.</p>
<p>Finally, the donut in these photos is massive, the picture does not do it justice. I finished most of it myself, but did have a little help.</p>

    <p>We packed a lot into today - in a good way. We started out the day with a short run and ended at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naschmarkt">Naschmarkt</a> for a few baked goods.</p>
<p>We then headed over to the marathon expo to pick up my number. Nothing too exciting happened at the expo.</p>
<p>The expo center was right by the Prater so we, of course, headed there after. We explored the grounds a bit and then rode the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Riesenrad">Wiener Riesenrad</a> <span>(</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a><span> for "Viennese giant wheel"). We got some great views of the city and beyond - it was such a clear day.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="/images/4dcc5fae403c1c4959307b3f43e340eb035d7567edac83e2955c8008b14458b8.jpg"></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Next we took off for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace">Schönbrunn Palace</a>, built by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg">Habsburg</a> family. We went on the audio tour and saw 40 impressive rooms. It was a bit hard to keep all the different kings, queens and their children straight, but it was a good tour. The grounds were even more impressive, but we didn't walk around them too much. I am hoping to find some time before we leave to spend some more time in the gardens.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We don't have too many plans for tomorrow, other than the marathon, but I hope to see something after - even if it's just back up the street to the Naschmarkt for more baked goods.</p>
<p>Danke für das Lesen.</p>

    <p>We began the day in Füssen with a plan to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">Neuschwanstein Castle</a> and then catch the trains to Vienna. We are on the last train now (wifi on the Austrian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railjet">Railjet</a>!) and so far things have exceeded all my expectations.</p>
<p>Neuschwanstein Castle was awesome. The views of the castles, the mountains and the valleys were all spectacular. </p>

<p>We'll be in Vienna for almost three full days. We don't have too many plans, but I'd like to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater">The Prater</a> and ride a trolley around the ring of central Vienna.</p>
<p>If you have any Vienna recommendations, please comment. Thanks!</p>

    <p><span>Today we made the trip from Bacharach to Füssen. The trip took about six and a half hours, but went well. I spent most of the trip taking pictures of Rachel, but by the end of the trip to Füssen, the scenery became amazing.</span></p>

<p>Yesterday, we didn't have access to the internet, so I didn't get to share any updates. We took another boat from Bacharach to Braubach. There we hiked up to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksburg">Marksburg Castle</a> and took a guided, English tour. This castle was still in tact and had an interesting history beginning in the 1100's and running all the way through WWII.</p>
<p>After the castle we walked around the town until the boat was supposed to come and take us to Koblenz. The boat never came, so we took the train and found a good dinner in Koblenz. We then took the train back to Bacharach and packed for our departure from Bacharach.</p>
<p>On the boat with some castle behind us.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/d87bd6c6fb684f75e13d6f33b47f6fae7ffcb23f807648dae35ed2fef484e3d2.jpg"></p>
<p>While on the boat we made friends with a tour group from Thailand.</p>

    <p>We spent the day exploring castles. We started off by climbing above Bacharach to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stahleck_Castle">Stahsech Castle</a>. After checking out the sights from up high, we ran down to the river and caught a cruise to St. Goar. At St. Goar we saw another castle, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheinfels_Castle">Rheinfels Castle</a>. We caught up with a guided tour, it was in German, but a docent-in-training spoke English and would give us the highlights of what was said. </p>
<p>I've got lots of photos to show off, but not enough internet to share them.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are headed back down the Rhine river to check out another castle.</p>
<p>Finally, it exciting trip news, we decided to skip Munich, stay in Bacharch an extra day and then head to Fuessen. In Fuessen, we are going to see - you guessed it - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">another castle</a>!</p>
<p>I'll add photos when I can. Thanks for reading.</p>

    <p><span>Today was our last in Amsterdam. We woke up, packed and then headed out for the Albert Cuypmarkt with hopes of finding some fresh herring and stoopwaffels. We were tight on time so we got there when the market opened and didn't find what we were looking for. If we'd set out for New York City t-shirts then we would have been in luck. We picked up some lunch and snacks for our train ride then found breakfast on the way back to our hotel to check out.</span></p>
<p>Today was the first day of riding the train and while they recommend you arrive about an hour early on your first day to get your tickets validated, we gave ourselves about 20 minutes. Luckily, 20 minutes were exactly how many it took to find the international desk, wait in line, get our ticket validated and find our platform.</p>
<p>The train to Cologne took about two and a half hours and was really comfortable. If all the trains we take are about as nice, we'll be in for some nice traveling. We weren't sure what we wanted to do in Cologne, but it was on the way to our eventual destination so we figured we should stop and take full advantage of our hop-on/hop-off train pass. When you leave the train station, the late Gothic Dom Cathedral is immediately in full view. This is the first Cathedral we have seen on the trip and I think they are only going to get bigger, but this one was pretty impressive. We walked around and inside and looked around and took way too many photos. After seeing the Cathedral we were out of things on our list to do in Cologne so we waited for our train at a nearby cafe and had some dessert.</p>
<p>We headed over to the station about 30 minutes before our train was supposed to depart and could tell things were a little crazy. People were talking about the schedule more than normal (in German, so I have no clue what they were saying) and all the trains from the last hour were on the board. I stopped by the info booth and was told the train we wanted to take was cancelled and needed to go catch a train on platform 7. Not sure which train or when it was supposed to come, Rachel and I headed up and tried to read the schedule and figure out what train we needed to catch. Eventually, we figured out that our train was actually on its way and "cancelled" probably meant "delayed" so we waited on platform 7. A few minutes before our train's new arrival time, an announcement in German comes on and everyone waiting on our side of the platform starts walking quickly for the stairs. We follow, and figure out that our train is already on a different platform and about to leave. Long story short, we made it. Longer story short, a fairly similar things happened to us in Koblenz and we waited for the train to Bacharach. By the time we made it, the town was asleep. Most of the lights were out. I think our hotel owner was asleep and had given up hope on us making it tonight.</p>
<p>But we made it, breakfast is from 9:00-10:00 am. And we're the only ones here in the hotel.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we plan on taking a river cruise up and down the river and exploring the towns around here. I'll take lots of pictures and let you know how it goes. Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>(The internet is too slow here to upload pictures, I'll add them when I can.)</p>

    <p>Today was our big day in Amsterdam. We slept in late and started the day off with lunch at <a href="http://www.stach-food.nl/">STACH</a> and then headed to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CDcQFjAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rijksmuseum.nl%2Fen&amp;ei=IKVBU9TtCeLH7Ab_1IHgBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEUsQdpZJGm86KP0tSOqyXIAsihgw&amp;sig2=FL1wuaey-6EJD8CS_m8AvA&amp;bvm=bv.64125504,d.ZGU">Rijkesmuseum</a> for a couple hours.</p>
<p>We had to stick to our schedule and get over to <a href="http://www.vangoghmuseum.nl/vgm/index.jsp">The Van Gogh Museum</a> by 3:00pm. On our walk between the museums we stopped for a quick snack and a few more photos.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/e7c8af56ce9a830f5b20739b829f1231b780560ffb7c6525feaafb5261c13de3.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>I really enjoyed The Van Gogh Museum. I didn't know much about Van Gogh before this and was fascinating to see his progression as a painter in just 10 years. I liked the various self portraits they had, their sunflowers were on loan in London and my favorite of the collection was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skull_of_a_Skeleton_with_Burning_Cigarette">Skull of a Skeleton with Burning Cigarette</a>.</p>
<p>After the museums we were headed out for dinner when we happened upon a stroopwafel stand. They were made to order and delicious.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/5909d12eb6409b0f7b2c852bde520bf1f48b8edae479b48d1ea88a004f0a1960.jpg"></p>
<p></p>
<p>Dinner was meat and potatoes for both of us. I think we ate at a pretty touristy place, but the food was great, so I have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>After dinner we wandered around just taking in the sights.</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning we plan to visit <a href="http://www.albertcuyp.nl/languages/english/">Albert Cuyp Markt</a> for some fresh herring and more stroopwafels. After, we are going to get on train and make a stop in Cologne for a couple hours then head to Bacharach for two nights.</p>
<p>I'll post more again soon, thanks for reading.</p>
