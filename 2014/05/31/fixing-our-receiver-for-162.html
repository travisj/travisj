    <p>Over the last few months our TV started getting harder and harder to watch. Every couple minutes the picture would go out for anywhere from a second to about fifteen. I started playing around with various settings and figured out it was actually our <a href="http://www.onkyousa.com/Products/model.php?m=TX-SR606&amp;class=Receiver">Oknyo TX-SR606 HDMI receiver</a>&nbsp;that was causing the problems. After doing a quick search, I learned this was a common problem for the receiver and a relatively easy fix (if you are comfortable with a soldering iron).</p>
<p>I found this helpful video on YouTube and watched it a couple times to get familiar with what I needed to do.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1GgDEtSug2o" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>The problem with the receiver was five capacitors that needed to be replaced. I ordered the parts and they arrived on Friday.</p>
<p>When I started out with the project I was optimistic I could fix the hdim board, but was not certain. The work to remove the old capacitors sounded delicate and I am quite out of practice with a soldering iron. But today was as good as any to either fix or break our receiver.</p>
<p>Below are the new capacitors along with the invoice. Shipping cost more than the actual parts I needed to replace on the board.</p>
<p><img src="/images/5abaa006844e58aac4b202c15ba345d3fb76d5c9fbcf7a4566811a44b8f76171.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I unplugged the receiver and took it over to the kitchen table, which would server as my makeshift lab.</p>
<p><img src="/images/60e881e6f47c7828c04196d9cf62b763ff8dff12757ba7976d565065703c6e25.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I got to work taking off the cover then unplugging and removing the hdmi card.</p>
<p><img src="/images/4437d4c70d89a86edd384c7396be7144b1fc2628cbb50e528c13a9dda4e6de1e.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/ca2a90066a20b4af07b254c7e4e19adfad3a56df281668c046a94d122f89ff52.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/a23aa8c5efca7176ad458716f7c28ec07b9c25529626acc87de170ec4dff39f4.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the card was out, I started gently removing the faulty capacitors. I removed them by using a pair of pliers to gently twist each capacitor until their legs broke off.</p>
<p><img src="/images/8e3c484cc64e8e7c34db7bfd1edb8b8764b6082f8ec9324b57350b79e649c8ec.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, I started soldering. It didn't go perfectly smooth, but Rachel helped me hold the new capacitors in place and by the time I finished putting the fifth capacitor in place I felt comfortable with the soldering iron. We used Rachel's kneaded eraser to hold the capacitors in place as I soldered them to the board.</p>
<p><img src="/images/111e6b5576cf607cff59ef85859bf089dd5e4dc8289f37b28a5f4a66724619b5.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the picture above, look for the long, black capacitors that say "10V 100uF" in the bottom of the picture. Those are two of the five capacitors that I added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With cleanup complete, I just had to put everything back together and then test it out.</p>
<p>I'll save all the drama and suspense and just say that my project worked! I plugged everything back in, turned everything on and was able to successfully see a picture on the screen. I then enabled a few configurations that the receiver could previously not handle and they worked. Finally, I watched TV for about 15 minutes without a single flicker and declared victory.</p>
<p>Even though the receiver is about seven years old, I didn't find myself in need of a new one. The features that have been added to the newer Onkyo receivers aren't very enticing, so I couldn't be happier that I was able to salvage this device all for $1.62.</p>
