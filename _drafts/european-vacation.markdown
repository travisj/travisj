Rachel and I have been very lucky to go on a couple of trips last year with Kenneth. He's a great travel companion and usually just goes with the flow. He's happy to just be with us and we are very happy to have him along for the adventure. After our successful 14 hour journey to Hawaii for a friend's wedding, we started thinking seriously about a trip back to Europe. We were fortunate to spend some time there [two years ago](/fourweeks) and I've wanted to go back for more ever since.

Well our flights are book and hotels reserved! We leave for France on March 26th and will first spend a week in Quimper and then head to Paris for a few days. From Paris we are flying to Vienna and then it's on to Prague. Finally, we'll spend a couple days in Amsterdam and we fly home on April 17th.

This trip will be a mix of cities we've been to before and a few new places. It was so hard to book a trip to Europe and not visit Rachel and I are both running races during the trip - surprise, surprise! I'm running the Paris Marathon and Rachel is running the Vienna City Half Marathon.

While I know the travel is going to be fun and the food is going to be great, I am most looking forward to spending three weeks with Rachel and Kenneth.
