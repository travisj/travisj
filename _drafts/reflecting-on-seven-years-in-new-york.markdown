title: "Seven Years in New York"
---

Seven years ago this month, Rachel, Crusher and I packed up our Subaru and set off for New York City. We loved life in Oregon, but had the opportunity to try something new on the east coast. Fast forward to today and I now love living here, but it was an adjustment and took hard work to get to this point.

Our first year in the city was really tough. We had ambitions of exploring the city every weekend, but I'd get home from work on Friday and be exhausted from both work and just getting to and from the work each day. We had to go to the grocery store each day, move our car twice a week, and plan out our errands in advance. Life was certainly different than we were used to in Oregon.

Then we started making friends and everything changed. Rachel joined Team in Training in Brooklyn to train with the group to run the New York City Marathon. We started doing things outside our apartment and getting to enjoy the city. We've been all around New York and a few new parts of the world with our friends - and sometimes the trips are not even running related.

This last year has been the most exciting. Kenneth was born on January 8th, 2015 and our life continues to be even more fun with him each day. He is such a great son and is so much fun to be with. He loves taking baths, watching Frozen and taking Crusher for walks.
