    <p>I ran the Vienna City Marathon today and Rachel was an amazing supporter. The race was fine and I got right about what I was expecting and hoping for. I'll run more later, but for the rest of our time in Europe (three more weeks!) we can just focus on eating and sightseeing at each stop.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/4f17fe6d1484e466d58c5fa4c0a12a6a4d490a3375f99b1f17f95664542ec45d.jpg" /></p>

<p>I enjoyed everything about the marathon today, but it was hard. I got to sleep in a lot, relative to other races I've done since the marathon didn't start until 9am. We left the place we are staying around 7:15 and headed to Jamse's hotel right by the start to wait in warmth. The race, itself, was a bit chaotic. There were people everywhere. Walking to bag drop took forever, getting back to our starting corals took forever. There were many spots around the course that were not wide enough to support the number of runners, which made for more dodging, weaving and even some stopping than I would have liked. This was my first race to not have mile markers and instead have kilometer markers which kept things fun converting remaining distances on the fly. This all made for a fun and interesting race.</p>
<p>I was a bit too ambitious last night when I thought we could do some more sightseeing after the race. Surprisingly, I am too tired. I'm resting, Rachel is doing some laundry for us and we'll get some dinner with our friends I ran the marathon with tonight.</p>
<p>We're still making plans for tomorrow, but we are here until our overnight train to Venice leaves at about 9:00pm. I am really hoping to ride the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringstra%C3%9Fe">Ringstra&szlig;e</a>&nbsp;and then see some combination of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere,_Vienna">Belvedere Palace/Art Museum</a>, and maybe back to&nbsp;Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace to tour the gardens.</p>
<p>Finally, the donut in these photos is massive, the picture does not do it justice. I finished most of it myself, but did have a little help.</p>
