    <p>After our great stay in Varenna, we headed to Lausanne, Switzerland for two nights. It ended up pretty cloudy and rainy, so we didn't get to see the Alps like I was hoping, but we had a relaxing time. We didn't do too much sightseeing, but we did walk around the town a bit as we searched out food and it looked comfortable (and pricey).</p>
<p>The highlights of Lausanne for me were getting a real Swiss dinner with heavy cheese fondue for dinner and relaxing with Rachel watching whatever show was on the English language television station.</p>
<p>Also, we came across a French show called Taxi Brooklyn that seemed to be on nonstop across a few different stations, but although it was filmed in English, it had been dubbed over in French.Â </p>
<p>I didn't take many pictures in Lausanne, but have made up for it now that we have made it to Paris. More to come soon.</p>

						Rachel and I spent most of April 2014 in Europe. It was an incredible trip that took us to parts of The Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland and France. I look forward to the day when we retrace our steps and do it all again.
