    <p>Today was a bit rainy and almost everything was closed due to May Day, but still had a great day. In the morning we headed out to Versailles to walk the grounds. We couldn't go in anything, but we could walk all over the gardens, so we covered as much ground as we could. I didn't mind not getting into the palace since we've seen quite a few this trip and didn't get to walk around in the impressive&nbsp;Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace gardens.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>
<p>In the evening we headed over to the Eiffel Tower and made a stop at each level - including a stop on the first level for dinner. Dinner was even more fun than I expected and running around the tower in the rain with Rachel was a blast.</p>

<p>Today's our last full day of the trip. We're going to the <a href="http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/home.html">Orsay Museum</a>&nbsp;and then to Notre Dame. We also plan to find and eat as many treats as possible.</p>

    <p>We've made it to our final destination, Paris. I have been looking forward to this stop the entire time and our first day out did not disappoint at all.</p>
<p>We have three full days here, so on the first day we decided to go the the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>We got an early start after breakfast at the hotel and took the metro to the Louvre. We first headed to the Italian painters section (since we didn't get enough of them in Italy) to fight the crowds and see Mona Lisa. Next, we headed to the French painters section. My favorite from this section was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coronation_of_Napoleon">The Coronation of Napolean</a>, though I was certain I'd already seen this same one somewhere else on our trip.</p>
<p>Our next destination was the Arc de Triomphe with a few stops along the way. We first headed to <a href="http://www.angelina-paris.fr/">Angelina</a></p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;for hot chocolate and then walked down&nbsp;<span>The Avenue des&nbsp;</span><span>Champs</span><span>-</span><span>&Eacute;lys&eacute;es for some window shopping.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We finally made it to the Arc de Triomphe and climbed to the top some impressive views of the area.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we headed back to the hotel, found a great place to eat then called it a day.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>Today we are going to walk around the&nbsp;Palace of Versailles. Today is May Day, which means many museums are closed, and the Palace is actually closed too, but we are going to walk around the garden and see the grounds.</span></p>

    <p>After our great stay in Varenna, we headed to Lausanne, Switzerland for two nights. It ended up pretty cloudy and rainy, so we didn't get to see the Alps like I was hoping, but we had a relaxing time. We didn't do too much sightseeing, but we did walk around the town a bit as we searched out food and it looked comfortable (and pricey).</p>
<p>The highlights of Lausanne for me were getting a real Swiss dinner with heavy cheese fondue for dinner and relaxing with Rachel watching whatever show was on the English language television station.</p>
<p>Also, we came across a French show called Taxi Brooklyn that seemed to be on nonstop across a few different stations, but although it was filmed in English, it had been dubbed over in French.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't take many pictures in Lausanne, but have made up for it now that we have made it to Paris. More to come soon.</p>

    <p>In my post about Varenna I accidentally left out one event that both horrified me and still has us laughing when we think about it.</p>
<p>One thing that is different with the hotels we have stayed at than ones I have stayed at before is that the hotel usually put the key on a big, heavy key ring and asks that leave the key at the front desk when you go out. The one difference with our hotel in Varenna was that the front desk closed at midnight, so if you wanted to stay out later, you had to take a bunch of different keys with you to get into the hotel and then into your room.</p>
<p>Also, it was warmer than usual in Varenna and the hotel had not yet turned on the air conditioning. It mostly got hot in the afternoon as the sun shone into our room, but we could open the doors to the balcony after the sun went down and got a nice, cooling breeze.</p>
<p>On our second night, we decided to sleep with the door open since it was still pretty warm in our room. At around 1:00 am, we woke up with someone trying to get into our room. I woke up before they got in, as they were starting to peak their head around the curtains blocking the open doorway, and yelled at them to get out of the room and go away.</p>
<p>It turns out that the other family staying at the hotel did not bring their keys with them and stayed out later than they were expecting. They got locked out, saw our open door and did not know it was a room so they tried to enter the hotel through our doorway.</p>
<p>Needless to say. we kept our doors shut the rest of the time we slept in Varenna.</p>

    <p>The next stop on our trip was Varenna, a small town in northern Italy on Lake Como. After a few weeks of busy cities and lots of museums we decided we needed a change of pace. Varenna was a perfect spot to recharge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After taking the train to Varenna, we had about a mile hike with our bags uphill to our hotel. It was hot, but when we made it to our room and walked out onto our balcony the view made it all worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On Friday we went for a hike and found another castle and a waterfall. This castle was cool because they had a small falconry and brought the birds out for us to see. The waterfall was cool because it was runoff from the snowy Italian Alps.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/fb3c1e3ab33416399e52f18c122bbd4d82829b1e81032692c8a6fba7966f6127.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>For our last full day on Lake Como we decided to take the boat over to Bellagio. Bellagio was nice, with more shopping and more people than Varenna, but not much else. We explored a bit and got some gelatto, then we caught the boat back to Varenna.</p>

<p>And with that, we are on the train to Switzerland. We are heading to Lausanne today and going to spend two nights eating fondue and checking out the Alps.</p>

    <p>Today we took full advantage of our Firenze Card and started the day off with a trip to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uffizi">Uffizi Gallery</a>. The Uffizi is said to have the greatest collection of Italian painters anywhere. The highlight for me was the room full of Botticelli paintings. Other than that, I didn't really enjoy it. Many works were hard to see because of the odd viewing areas through the transoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After lunch we did some much-needed laundry and set out for T<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galleria_dell%27Accademia">he Accademia</a>. I didn't know anything about this museum except that Michelangelo's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_(Michelangelo)">David</a> was here. <a href="http://instagram.com/p/nIxqJCi0Az/">David</a> was more impressive than I expected. We've seen a lot of sculpture over the last few weeks, but David was, better than anything else we've seen. It was the combination of size (we overheard an amateur tour guide claim he was 17' 1") and clean finish that impressed me the most. Other than David, the gallery didn't have much that captured my interest.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we head to Varenna on Lake Como for a couple days of relaxation and hiking. Before we leave Florence, we are going to get a little more use out of our cards and climb to the top of the bell tower and visit the Duomo Museum.</p>
<p>I didn't take as many pictures today, but really like this one of Rachel from the roof garden at the Uffizi with the Duomo in the background.</p>

    <p>Yesterday we left Rome and arrived in Florence. To maximize our time in Florence, we decided to get the Firenze Card, which gives us access to most museums and lets us wait in the priority lines, which usually move very fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made quick use of the card by first climbing to the top of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florence_Cathedral">Duomo</a>&nbsp;and were rewarded with amazing views in all directions. Once we got to the top, we got to spend as much time as we wanted looking out over Florence. Coming down was fun as we had to negotiate the small staircases and free space with people coming up.</p>
<p>After the Duomo we set out to find dinner and followed dinner up with some gelato recommended to us by a friend.</p>

    <p>We took a day trip to Naples before leaving Rome. It was only about an hour train ride on the high speed train. I wasn't sure what to expect, but did know to expect it to be a bit more intense than Rome. And it definitely was. We got off the train and went straight for pizza at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.damichele.net/">L' Antica Pizzeria da Michele</a>. The pizza was some of the best I've ever had. It was just a margherita, but the sauce, cheese and crust were all perfect. We were seated with a couple of locals that sort of spoke English (much better than our Italian) and had a good time chatting with them about Naples.</p>
<p>We then went to the National Archeological Museum and roamed the halls for a couple hours. They have a bunch of stuff from Pompeii and it is really interesting to see their art and everyday tools, but since they have so much it all starts to look the same after a while. I was most impressed with their baking ware and dishes. They looked much more advanced than I would have expected for nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>We then decided to try and find a beach or at least see the water, so we wandered in that general direction for a bit. Along the way we walked through the&nbsp;Umberto the Ist Gallery. It seems like at one time the gallery was an impressive shopping center, but today it just feels like a massive, abandoned structure with people selling fake handbags and scarves in the middle. We tried a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sfogliatelle">sfogliatelle</a> and I found it to be about as good as I thought&nbsp;<span>sweetened ricotta&nbsp;</span><span>cheese in a pastry would taste.</span></p>
<p><span>Once we finally made it to the water, we took in a clear view of&nbsp;Mount Vesuvius, snapped a few pictures and headed back to the train station. I was ready to leave Naples. The food was great, but the city was more intense and busy that I liked.</span></p>

<p>We got back to Rome and got ready for our trip to Florence. More on that soon.</p>
<p>We originally planned to go to Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland at the end of this week, but started looking at the weather recently and saw that it was going to be in the teens and 100% chance of snow. We packed as light as we could for this trip, which meant my snow coat didn't make the cut. As a result, we cancelled our hotel in Lauterbrunnen and are looking for an alternative. We are thinking about heading toward Lake Geneva in Switzerland, maybe staying in Lausanne, but are open to recommendations. We really want to stay in Switzerland and be as close to the Alps as possible, but still be warm enough to go out and hike. If you have any suggestions, please let us know. Thanks.</p>

    <p>Yesterday we spent the day seeing the ancient sites in Rome. We started out at the Pantheon and had bright sunlight beaming through the dome’s opening.</p>

<p>After some wandering and lunch, we headed for the Coliseum. I’ve seen the arena many times in pictures and on TV, but still found it massive and impressive.</p>

<p>We are now on the train and headed for Naples. We plan to see the national archeological museum and eat pizza.</p>

    <p>Today we went on a three and a half hour guided tour of the Vatican and it was both impressive and exhausting. There is so much to see in the Vatican Museum, but after a while it all starts looking the same and you lose track the the different 266 popes. We did get to see a lot on the tour - a couple gardens, various walkways between the residences filled with statues and painted ceilings, the Sistine Chapel and St. Peter's Basilica.</p>
<p>I enjoyed St. Peter's Basilica the most because of just how massive and ornate the building is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After dinner we walked around a bit and found our way to Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our tour of the catacombs for tomorrow was cancelled because a few of the sights are closed due to Easter so we are figuring out our plans now. Suggestions are welcome. Thanks.</p>

    <p>This morning Rachel and I took a walking tour of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark%27s_Basilica">St Mark's Basilica</a>. Before entering the church, we had about an hour walk around the area with the tour guide pointing out other sights - like the Rialto Bridge and Marco Polo's house.&nbsp;St Mark's Basilica was the highlight, of course. The inside was massive and the mosaic work was amazing. We also got to go upstairs to the museum to see the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_of_Saint_Mark">horses</a>&nbsp;and look out over the plaza.</p>

<p>After the tour, we caught the water bus back to the train station and boarded the train for Rome. This was the first truly high-speed train we have ridden on this trip, reaching a maximum speed of about 250 km/h. At top speed it was a challenge to walk around the car.</p>
<p>Once in Rome, we checked into the hotel, ate some pizza and now are resting before our big day tomorrow.&nbsp;We are going on a tour of the Vatican tomorrow and I am pretty excited to see it all.</p>
<p>Have you ever been to Rome? We are here until Tuesday, what should we do? Thanks for sharing.</p>

    <p>Today we took it easy. We left the hotel late and walked toward&nbsp;Campo Santa Margherita to find some lunch and gelato. We found both and they were delicious - especially the gelato (<a href="https://twitter.com/shaneadams/status/456039525207126017">thanks Shane</a>!).</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/55dbf1e0792712509b61bbfb32a280a2b7e0ab83e821194706a94b57188ca184.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>We then walked over to the <a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/default.html">Peggy Guggenheim Collection</a>&nbsp;and had a nice afternoon looking at art. The permanent collection is comprised of works from Peggy Guggenheim's personal collection and was nice, but I greatly preferred the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/collection2.php?id_cat=18">Hannelore B. and Rudolph B. Schulhof Collection</a>. My favorite from the Schulhof collection were the Ellsworth Kelly paintings and would have liked to have seen the de Kooning and Rothko in the collection, but they were not up. From the permanent collection, my favorite was from an artist I had never heard of before. named Ren&eacute; Margritte, titled <a href="http://www.guggenheim-venice.it/inglese/collections/artisti/dettagli/opere_dett.php?id_art=103&amp;id_opera=206&amp;page=">Empire of Light</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the Guggenheim, we walked around a bit and found our way to&nbsp;Piazza San Marco to sit and watch all the activity as the sun went down.</p>

<p>Tomorrow is our last day in Venice. We are going on a guided tour of&nbsp;St Mark's Basilica in the morning and then taking the train to Rome.</p>

    <p>We decided to check out Burano and Murano for our second day in Venice. I loved Burano. When we got off the bus, we had a fried fish lunch right by the water and then explored the area for a couple hours.</p>

<p>We wanted to try and fit in Torcello, too, but were running short on time, so we took the bus back to Murano. On Murano, we wandered through the streets and into the many glass shops, Rachel found a glass ring and we got a couple snacks before catching the bus back to Venice.</p>

    <p>We arrived to a sunny Venice at about 8:30am. The overnight train was pretty good. We had a small room to ourselves and were both able to sleep pretty well through the train ride.</p>
<p>We exited the train station and were immediately in Venice - the Grand Canal was right in front of us with boats moving in every direction. We caught the next&nbsp;Vaporetto toward our hotel.</p>
<p>Venice has lots of little streets everywhere and only certain ones have bridges, so I was quite proud of myself for unlocking my phone before leaving for the trip and picking up an Italian SIM card at the train station which gave us plenty of data for loading maps (or in Rachel's case, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook).</p>
<p>It was too early to check into our room, so we dropped our bags off and wandered around Venice for a couple hours. It was a beautiful day and nearly impossible to pass a canal without taking a picture.</p>

    <p>Yesterday was our last day in Vienna, and since we didn't catch our night train to Venice until 9pm, we had the whole day to cross off any remaining activities. So after a traditional Viennese breakfast with our friends, we parted ways and headed to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>&nbsp;for a look at their treasury. They had some interesting relics and a great view of the inside of the cathedral.</p>

<p>Our next stop was the&nbsp;Capuchin Church to see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Crypt">Imperial Crypt</a> of the Habsburg family. I have become a fan of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria">Franz Joseph</a>&nbsp;on this trip and was especially excited to see his tomb.</p>

<p>Finally, we headed to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Treasury,_Vienna">Imperial Treasury</a>&nbsp;to see the Habsburg's collection of family treasures and religious relics. My favorite item in the collection was the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Crown_of_the_Holy_Roman_Empire">Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire</a>.</p>
<p>We also found time to sneak in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachertorte">Sachertorte</a>&nbsp;and apple strudel. So delicious!</p>

<p></p>
<p>With a fun day in the books, we headed for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_Westbahnhof_railway_station">Wien Westbahnhof</a>&nbsp;and boarded the overnight train to Venice. More on that to come.</p>

    <p>I ran the Vienna City Marathon today and Rachel was an amazing supporter. The race was fine and I got right about what I was expecting and hoping for. I'll run more later, but for the rest of our time in Europe (three more weeks!) we can just focus on eating and sightseeing at each stop.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/4f17fe6d1484e466d58c5fa4c0a12a6a4d490a3375f99b1f17f95664542ec45d.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I enjoyed everything about the marathon today, but it was hard. I got to sleep in a lot, relative to other races I've done since the marathon didn't start until 9am. We left the place we are staying around 7:15 and headed to Jamse's hotel right by the start to wait in warmth. The race, itself, was a bit chaotic. There were people everywhere. Walking to bag drop took forever, getting back to our starting corals took forever. There were many spots around the course that were not wide enough to support the number of runners, which made for more dodging, weaving and even some stopping than I would have liked. This was my first race to not have mile markers and instead have kilometer markers which kept things fun converting remaining distances on the fly. This all made for a fun and interesting race.</p>
<p>I was a bit too ambitious last night when I thought we could do some more sightseeing after the race. Surprisingly, I am too tired. I'm resting, Rachel is doing some laundry for us and we'll get some dinner with our friends I ran the marathon with tonight.</p>
<p>We're still making plans for tomorrow, but we are here until our overnight train to Venice leaves at about 9:00pm. I am really hoping to ride the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringstra%C3%9Fe">Ringstra&szlig;e</a>&nbsp;and then see some combination of&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Stephen's_Cathedral,_Vienna">St. Stephen's Cathedral</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belvedere,_Vienna">Belvedere Palace/Art Museum</a>, and maybe back to&nbsp;Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace to tour the gardens.</p>
<p>Finally, the donut in these photos is massive, the picture does not do it justice. I finished most of it myself, but did have a little help.</p>

    <p>We packed a lot into today - in a good way. We started out the day with a short run and ended at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naschmarkt">Naschmarkt</a>&nbsp;for a few baked goods.</p>
<p>We then headed over to the marathon expo to pick up my number. Nothing too exciting happened at the expo.</p>
<p>The expo center was right by the Prater so we, of course, headed there after. We explored the grounds a bit and then rode the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener_Riesenrad">Wiener Riesenrad</a>&nbsp;<span>(</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language" title="German language">German</a><span>&nbsp;for "Viennese giant wheel"). We got some great views of the city and beyond - it was such a clear day.</span></p>
<p><span><img alt="image" src="/images/4dcc5fae403c1c4959307b3f43e340eb035d7567edac83e2955c8008b14458b8.jpg" /></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Next we took off for&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nbrunn_Palace">Sch&ouml;nbrunn Palace</a>,&nbsp;built by the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Habsburg">Habsburg</a>&nbsp;family. We went on the audio tour and saw 40 impressive rooms. It was a bit hard to keep all the different kings, queens and their children straight, but it was a good tour. The grounds were even more impressive, but we didn't walk around them too much. I am hoping to find some time before we leave to spend some more time in the gardens.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/85ea95775cb5537a9006822b914c6889e5fa271871304ae8a64c2bd217c93b91.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>We don't have too many plans for tomorrow, other than the marathon, but I hope to see something after - even if it's just back up the street to the&nbsp;Naschmarkt for more baked goods.</p>
<p>Danke f&uuml;r das Lesen.</p>

    <p>We began the day in F&uuml;ssen with a plan to see&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">Neuschwanstein Castle</a>&nbsp;and then catch the trains to Vienna. We are on the last train now (wifi on the Austrian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railjet">Railjet</a>!) and so far things have exceeded all my expectations.</p>
<p>Neuschwanstein Castle was awesome. The views of the castles, the mountains and the valleys were all spectacular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'll be in Vienna for almost three full days. We don't have too many plans, but I'd like to go to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prater">The Prater</a>&nbsp;and ride a trolley around the ring of central Vienna.</p>
<p>If you have any Vienna recommendations, please comment. Thanks!</p>

    <p><span>Today we made the trip from Bacharach to F&uuml;ssen. The trip took about six and a half hours, but went well. I spent most of the trip taking pictures of Rachel, but by the end of the trip to F&uuml;ssen, the scenery became amazing.</span></p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/7901172bcb8952c15d10f7345d90983095586c08e2ea50534b75bac478db49d9.jpg" /></p>

<p>Yesterday, we didn't have access to the internet, so I didn't get to share any updates. We took another boat from Bacharach to Braubach. There we hiked up to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marksburg">Marksburg Castle</a>&nbsp;and took a guided, English tour. This castle was still in tact and had an interesting history beginning in the 1100's and running all the way through WWII.</p>
<p>After the castle we walked around the town until the boat was supposed to come and take us to Koblenz. The boat never came, so we took the train and found a good dinner in Koblenz. We then took the train back to Bacharach and packed for our departure from Bacharach.</p>
<p>On the boat with some castle behind us.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/d87bd6c6fb684f75e13d6f33b47f6fae7ffcb23f807648dae35ed2fef484e3d2.jpg" /></p>
<p>While on the boat we made friends with a tour group from Thailand.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/8b3be580557c710ef62e925918b4d699331755c471c8ea18b3627023cceb6338.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>And a few other shots from the day.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we are getting up early to head to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuschwanstein_Castle">Neuschwanstein Castle</a>&nbsp;and maybe&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schloss_Hohenschwangau">Hohenschwangau Castle</a>. After that, we are hopping back on the train and heading to Vienna, Austria. This will be our third country and fourth city.</p>
