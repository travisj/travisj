    <p>Kenneth and I got to spend more quality time together this weekend. We took Crusher for a couple walks and inspected the bark of nearly every tree along the way. Crusher does not mind the slowness involved with bark inspection since he’s usually on the hunt for the next smell to track down. The weather was really nice this weekend, so I didn’t mind the slow stroll with the boys.</p>

<p>When inside, we played a lot of music!</p>

<p><img src="/images/20160228_IMG_8764.JPG" alt="ken with his microphone" /></p>

<p>Rachel and I recently watched Cooked, the documentary based on the book by Michael Pollan. It was a great series and I was especially drawn to the part where he makes his own bread. We looked up a few recipes and started making our own sourdough starter last weekend and this weekend got to start making the bread. The loafs turned out well enough that they could pass for bread, but not quite sourdough. I think the start has to grow a bit more. It was fun making the bread and trying to improve on each loaf as I created it. More to come here, I’m sure.</p>

<p>I started watching the talks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGuKhcnrqGA&amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY">React.js Conf 2016</a> this weekend and am pretty excited about the upcoming possibilities with React. I am especially excited about the “learn once, write anywhere” ideas behind the framework as it grows beyond just the web browser.</p>

<p>Finally, we trekked into the city today to visit friends in the hospital that just had a baby. It was fun to be back at the same hospital where Ken was born and think back to when we started our life with him.</p>

    <p>Kenneth is growing up! He’s about 14 months old and walking all over the apartment. He loves playing with magnets, balls and all my electronics. He is so much fun to be with, but it’s also nice that he still naps twice a day.</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures I’ve taken of him over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>We have reached the halfway point in our Northeast vacation. After spending a couple days in Boston, we made it to Maine to meet up with family and friends. We are staying right on the water and spectacular views out every window.</p>
<figure data-orig-width="6000" data-orig-height="4000" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/65611c31a62a13b491804f8ebcc4c4bbbda1ef6afaac6cb39235c46b6e88b3ad.jpg" data-orig-width="6000" data-orig-height="4000" /></figure>
<p>The water is too cold to swim in, but loads of fun boat and kayak. We’ve taken a couple trips out on the water, with an excursion over to Russ Island for some hiking and a packed lunch. This was Kenneth’s first time out in a boat and while he didn’t love it, he did a great job.<br /></p>

<p>Yesterday we took a trip to Acadia National Park. The weather was nearly perfect from the top and we had great views of Bar Harbor and the surrounding area. Kenneth didn’t like the wind, so he had to spend some time in the car, but everyone else enjoyed the national park.<br /></p>

<p>After coming down Cadillac Mountain, we headed for Bar Harbor and spent a couple more hours in the sun and sea breeze. Rachel, Kenneth and I found some shade by the water and took a nap while everyone else shopped around town.</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="4000" data-orig-width="6000"><img src="/images/63cf82bbd4131cc19d59309100c5c03a4ecf89da5066976d02c50e2bcd08c242.jpg" data-orig-height="4000" data-orig-width="6000" /></figure>
<p>Most importantly, Kenneth has gotten to spend a lot of time with his grandparents - they know just how to make him squeal with excitement.</p>

<p>We plan on spending the afternoon at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and catching the Astros vs. Red Sox game at Fenway Park tonight.</p>

<p>Crusher was in such a playful mood last Saturday. He was running all over the apartment and even trying to play with Kenneth some. He caught his breath just long enough for me to capture this shot then he was off again.</p>

<p>Kenneth got to talk to his grandparents tonight on FaceTime. He showed off his ability to sit all on his own and a few other tricks. When they make big movements, he’s able to see them and pays attention for a few seconds. It’s great having technology that keeps us connected even when we are thousands of miles apart.</p>

<p><span>Kenneth rushed into our lives on January 8th. Rachel woke up early with contractions, but by the time I needed to get ready for work, she didn't expect the baby to come any time that day so I went on my way. By two in the afternoon her contractions were coming every couple minutes and she told me to come home, she thought the baby was probably on his way.</span></p>
<p>We left for the hospital by three and made it by four. By 4:25 Rachel was in a delivery room with doctors telling her to push. All those breathing exercises and early laboring techniques we learned in our classes were thrown out the window, we got to the hospital just in time for her to push the baby out. I was quite nervous because she was in so much pain, but the doctors were beyond impressed with her because she was so strong &nbsp;in making it to this point on her own. I was and still am so proud of her.</p>
<p>After some intense pushing on Rachel's part, we got to meet Kenneth. He was born at 6:41 pm and was so unbelievably cute. He was so happy to be hugging Rachel and she was just as happy to be hugging him right back.</p>
<p>Rachel and Kenneth stayed at the hospital for a couple days and then on Saturday I got to drive them home.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/925b559976799bc79dfb8e790cfd7cd198d514b103216c45aa328ea8b709e37f.jpg" /></p>
<p><span>Kenneth has been home with us for one week and is the perfect baby already. I love holding him, watching him make funny faces and listen to his adorable sounds. All he really does at this point is eat and sleep, but it is still so great to be with him.</span></p>
<p><span>This is no surprise to me, but Rachel is an amazing mom to Ken. Leading up to his birth, she prepared in every way possible for Ken. She is so loving toward him and he is such a happy baby in her arms.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>It's taken Rachel and me a long time to get to this point in our lives, but I am very excited for everything that lies ahead.</span></p>

    <p>I was fortunate to attend a friend's bachelor party at Yankee Stadium and even though the Yankees lost, it was still a fun way to send Matt off. For the game we had a suite on the first base with more than enough room and food for us.</p>
<p>We got the stadium around noon and settled in.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/8fd21b1900b0869c0ec0cb8ca791a56756d8b291e9e5075554080badd204a1a1.jpg" /></p>

<p>Around the start of the game, a couple of Yankees historians game by to show and let us hold a few historical objects. We got to see a game-worn jersey from Jeter's 3,000th hit game (apparently he quite a few that day), home plate from the last game at the old stadium and first at the new one, a bat signed and used by Mickey Mantle in the 1958 World Series, and a couple recent World Series rings.</p>

<p>The game, itself, didn't go to well for the Yankees, but I still had a great time.</p>

    <p>I had so much fun taking pictures on my run last weekend, I decided to give it another try yesterday. I had a twelve mile run on the calendar and decided to run over the Brooklyn Bridge and then up the West Side Highway a couple miles, then turn around and come home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As with all runs, I eagerly await my watch to sync up with the satellites.</p>
<p><img src="/images/33e775b1832e6efb6191ee83870b9cca1d4866e2d4b144b565f0fcaeeaf6ccbe.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I got an early start and had the roads to myself.</p>
<p><img src="/images/29a83be9a6336ecd1d94cf5ee29dc5ea1b5a88fed4b964b352eda29f5c0e9fa9.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>There was a lot of car traffic leading up to the bridge, since it was closed to cars into Manhattan, but the path for bikes and pedestrians was pretty quiet.</p>
<p><img src="/images/39c43490435518d53f32b8f2369ffb8d21f9cb5c2ccd1fe4485fe8bcc9d19430.jpg" /></p>

<p>After coming off the bridge, I headed west for a couple more miles.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2fc1c430c5bb610e7388877529617707a8b042c9449a381eed2f76c1cc2b5f58.jpg" /></p>

<p>I then turned around and headed back toward the World Trade Center.</p>
<p><img src="/images/8537ed47a45724143ec563c70de17f18664baceae729e67d6c982e559543d18d.jpg" /></p>
<p>Remember how crowded the Manhattan side of the bridge was last weekend. Thanks to the earlier start this week, it wasn't too bad at all.</p>
<p><img src="/images/cc854674fa808119ed81f846c0dd9dffa48257a1fafd071fa918857c0a04fbcf.jpg" /></p>
<p>With that, I put the phone away and knocked out a couple more miles at marathon pace and then cooled down the rest of the way home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once home, Rachel and I went to get some breakfast and then I headed out to Yankee Stadium for the afternoon game.</p>

    <p>I went for a run this morning and since it was a beautiful day, I decided to take a few pictures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Starting off the run on our quiet street. al di la has already cleaned the sidewalks, but nothing else is happening.</p>
<p><img src="/images/62da0734f1f1734526b9b3bc5fc1583dcaadde44f6ea20e4cb0502d5a214696a.jpg" /></p>
<p>I ran across to Columbia st. to catch the bike bath and make my way up toward Brooklyn Bridge Park.</p>
<p><img src="/images/5b3bb4af87237c782db5292a8d17cfd27630743e082f2410bef3319eff3a9f3c.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>I think this is Pier 5, which has lots of soccer fields.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c9af47357f16b89440310aa29ecb5b9ebcb5b23bb2df2ed4e54e9e9f0186c591.jpg" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/3e87d69d301cfe4e1d6fc4185e7d91013a3d64cbf7b2b90aed55f40673d7bbec.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I took the new path and headed toward the brand new Pier 2.</p>
<p><img src="/images/4d773dccbe1ea5b2c8deb4b172009cff8a495574243d1198f8e24777ac8deff8.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Pier 2, the new fitness pier.</p>
<p><img src="/images/2c80424a11d66f0ed0437da024c9a9b4a2747395d7a5437b33a27631e3ba9da2.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Got back to the main path and had my first good view of the bridge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/45b6a02770e32d104e8f9cda39aa1e9b07a1564d6e20b6298b36db3e9b23e115.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>I made it down to Pier 1 and took a quick stop for some photos of Manhattan and bridges.</p>
<p><img src="/images/e946ffdfb568d673e4043be1643380463b38f776fbfa5ee5f2444507a2e14fb6.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/6e96da3062e6cd2dc5a259616ad9260036bdcae0ed43d0e3b6e5b8e2e3904e1d.jpg" /></p>

<p>I then headed under the Brooklyn Bridge and over to the carousel.</p>
<p><img src="/images/a59268e39beaa0723ea88d7c01d9486cbfb45c491d43526f8c3ecca5f702d910.jpg" /></p>

<p>That's obviously me in the reflection.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c57b24f9dbe5845eb20fe4a871108935ace0c79a7a67da3a64b3b30bc8fe65a2.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>Looks like there was going to be a viewing party here later, my guess is the World Cup.</p>
<p><img src="/images/c71955cf38ddb82a5ba62f12cb67872b4103f7d6e841dc5e915b32749dd1d31e.jpg" /></p>
<p>Just a street scene from Dumbo. We don't come over here often, but it looks like somewhere we should return to.</p>
<p><img src="/images/54fc8a672a3c9fcdc9ed7205e40ecd667850a688448c76fe092839a2bc938951.jpg" /></p>
<p>I made my way back to the entrance of the Manhattan Bridge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/87dcdeb28afb8349ca29c78f453d34d1c40c7c556fa2e0abd3eda8099d88ef93.jpg" /></p>
<p>Climbing the bridge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/78ff6affe266f12d02ac9d0c8fa4a44e54125f4bfc634fbccee17fffc87a9dc6.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/e18e007c9e616b2ebfefedda7f46e88db9e94288f8c2fb4cfe3e48fbf2a170df.jpg" /></p>
<p>My favorite view in the entire city.</p>
<p><img src="/images/11e2a03af9f3b43171cf20a4530f36b535a1242478e93d3255f237df89de2fca.jpg" /></p>

<p>I don't know what this says or means, but every time I see it, I wonder about it.</p>
<p><img src="/images/02bbfee62476aa65b97b5b4ee0abfdad208e2e971587403b718d5d960ab657c6.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>This cop tried to hit me as he rolled through a stop sign. I stared him down, kept running, then snapped this as he passed. I made sure to wait for the walk sign before running through the next light, though.</p>
<p><img src="/images/45646d4c7a9f9d3666ef282027259e39b058105e6cdd8408844954181338c929.jpg" /></p>

<p></p>
<p>Making my way back to the Brooklyn Bridge.</p>
<p><img src="/images/d1c4e1b7439de9d583adbeef70f0e7d24949060d6a23874a0e397c1f7978755e.jpg" /></p>
<p>Look at all those people. I guess I didn't make it to the bridge early enough. Lots of dodging people and bikes for the mile and a half.</p>
<p><img src="/images/78e8b9e3629b3b93084a549229c9bad15b90171e14dce41b76dea4b977efd7c7.jpg" /></p>
<p>Something happened to my phone's camera and the next few pictures came out of focus. I probably enabled some setting without knowing.</p>
<p><img src="/images/9cd886f76a4768255e64054470a37732f02376ba152c88cf635f32514545f91d.jpg" /></p>

<p>"All is fare in love and Brooklyn"</p>
<p><img src="/images/7deb733e811a81212e4c3f681c8728bd27cbede89163c110c44671980bd20005.jpg" /></p>
<p>Smith St. and Atlantic.</p>
<p><img src="/images/aade8cea28d8318ae0689346f376fdc92029dc101dc74b73b11800587b6a0452.jpg" /></p>
<p>Made it back to 4th Ave.</p>
<p><img src="/images/452bff393c5bfe082758d848b7dd6343a9c24a7e7e144467bdf0d9f5ebb45f8f.jpg" /></p>
<p>And done!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Wrapping it up with a couple of bagel sandwiches with these two.</p>

    <p>Over the last few months our TV started getting harder and harder to watch. Every couple minutes the picture would go out for anywhere from a second to about fifteen. I started playing around with various settings and figured out it was actually our <a href="http://www.onkyousa.com/Products/model.php?m=TX-SR606&amp;class=Receiver">Oknyo TX-SR606 HDMI receiver</a>&nbsp;that was causing the problems. After doing a quick search, I learned this was a common problem for the receiver and a relatively easy fix (if you are comfortable with a soldering iron).</p>
<p>I found this helpful video on YouTube and watched it a couple times to get familiar with what I needed to do.</p>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/1GgDEtSug2o" width="560"></iframe></p>
<p>The problem with the receiver was five capacitors that needed to be replaced. I ordered the parts and they arrived on Friday.</p>
<p>When I started out with the project I was optimistic I could fix the hdim board, but was not certain. The work to remove the old capacitors sounded delicate and I am quite out of practice with a soldering iron. But today was as good as any to either fix or break our receiver.</p>
<p>Below are the new capacitors along with the invoice. Shipping cost more than the actual parts I needed to replace on the board.</p>
<p><img src="/images/5abaa006844e58aac4b202c15ba345d3fb76d5c9fbcf7a4566811a44b8f76171.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I unplugged the receiver and took it over to the kitchen table, which would server as my makeshift lab.</p>
<p><img src="/images/60e881e6f47c7828c04196d9cf62b763ff8dff12757ba7976d565065703c6e25.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>I got to work taking off the cover then unplugging and removing the hdmi card.</p>
<p><img src="/images/4437d4c70d89a86edd384c7396be7144b1fc2628cbb50e528c13a9dda4e6de1e.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/ca2a90066a20b4af07b254c7e4e19adfad3a56df281668c046a94d122f89ff52.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="/images/a23aa8c5efca7176ad458716f7c28ec07b9c25529626acc87de170ec4dff39f4.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the card was out, I started gently removing the faulty capacitors. I removed them by using a pair of pliers to gently twist each capacitor until their legs broke off.</p>
<p><img src="/images/8e3c484cc64e8e7c34db7bfd1edb8b8764b6082f8ec9324b57350b79e649c8ec.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>Next, I started soldering. It didn't go perfectly smooth, but Rachel helped me hold the new capacitors in place and by the time I finished putting the fifth capacitor in place I felt comfortable with the soldering iron. We used Rachel's kneaded eraser to hold the capacitors in place as I soldered them to the board.</p>
<p><img src="/images/111e6b5576cf607cff59ef85859bf089dd5e4dc8289f37b28a5f4a66724619b5.jpg" /></p>
<p></p>
<p>In the picture above, look for the long, black capacitors that say "10V 100uF" in the bottom of the picture. Those are two of the five capacitors that I added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With cleanup complete, I just had to put everything back together and then test it out.</p>
<p>I'll save all the drama and suspense and just say that my project worked! I plugged everything back in, turned everything on and was able to successfully see a picture on the screen. I then enabled a few configurations that the receiver could previously not handle and they worked. Finally, I watched TV for about 15 minutes without a single flicker and declared victory.</p>
<p>Even though the receiver is about seven years old, I didn't find myself in need of a new one. The features that have been added to the newer Onkyo receivers aren't very enticing, so I couldn't be happier that I was able to salvage this device all for $1.62.</p>
