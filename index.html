    <p>Rachel and I have been very lucky to go on a couple of trips last year with Kenneth. He’s a great travel companion and usually just goes with the flow. He’s happy to just be with us and we are very happy to have him along for the adventure. After our successful 14 hour journey to Hawaii for a friend’s wedding, we started thinking seriously about a trip back to Europe. We were fortunate to spend some time there <a href="/fourweeks">two years ago</a> and I’ve wanted to go back for more ever since.</p>

<p>Well our flights are book and hotels reserved! We leave for France on March 26th and will first spend a week in Quimper and then head to Paris for a few days. From Paris we are flying to Vienna and then it’s on to Prague. Finally, we’ll spend a couple days in Amsterdam and we fly home on April 17th.</p>

<p>This trip will be a mix of cities we’ve been to before and a few new places. It was so hard to book a trip to Europe and not visit Rachel and I are both running races during the trip - surprise, surprise! I’m running the Paris Marathon and Rachel is running the Vienna City Half Marathon.</p>

<p>While I know the travel is going to be fun and the food is going to be great, I am most looking forward to spending three weeks with Rachel and Kenneth.</p>

    <p>I don’t plan to post everytime I bake bread, but Rachel and I have further refined our recipe and had a near-perfect raisin walnut sourdough bread this morning.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20160312_DSC_1869.JPG" alt="raisin walnut sourdough"></p>

<p>I added an extra 75 grams of flour, 575g total, and cooked the bread for an hour at 450 degrees. The key we found with our oven is to put a baking sheet under the dutch oven to prevent the bottom of the bread from burning.</p>

<p>Bread fresh out of the oven makes for a pretty awesome breakfast.</p>

    <p>I mentioned in <a href="/2016/02/28/weekend-update">my last post</a> that I started baking my own sourdough bread from my own starter. I’ve now been at it for two weeks and think the bread is really starting to come along.</p>

<p>Last night I prepared the dough for a basic sourdough bread, based on <a href="http://www.theclevercarrot.com/2014/01/sourdough-bread-a-beginners-guide/">this recipe</a>. I put in a bit more flour than the recipe called for because of a previous trial with the recipe and think it was about right, but will maybe do a bit less next time. Given that it’s winter and a bit colder, I let bulk fermentation go for about 14 hours. I then split the dough in half and baked the first loaf.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20160307_DSC_1824.JPG" alt="first loaf"></p>

<p><img src="/images/20160307_DSC_1828.JPG" alt="first loaf cut"></p>

<p>The first loaf baked in the dutch oven with the lid on for 60 minutes. Since our oven has been burning the bread, I set the oven to about 410°F and the temperature seemed about right this time. It still came out a bit overdone on the outside and maybe a touch underdone inside. The sourdough flavor is starting to show in these latest loaves.</p>

<p><img src="/images/20160307_DSC_1825.JPG" alt="second loaf"></p>

<p>The second loaf got an extra hour for the second rise and I baked it for only 50 minutes and came out looking perfect.</p>

    <p>Kenneth and I got to spend more quality time together this weekend. We took Crusher for a couple walks and inspected the bark of nearly every tree along the way. Crusher does not mind the slowness involved with bark inspection since he’s usually on the hunt for the next smell to track down. The weather was really nice this weekend, so I didn’t mind the slow stroll with the boys.</p>

<p>When inside, we played a lot of music!</p>

<p><img src="/images/20160228_IMG_8764.JPG" alt="ken with his microphone"></p>

<p>Rachel and I recently watched Cooked, the documentary based on the book by Michael Pollan. It was a great series and I was especially drawn to the part where he makes his own bread. We looked up a few recipes and started making our own sourdough starter last weekend and this weekend got to start making the bread. The loaves turned out well enough that they could pass for bread, but not quite sourdough. I think the starter has to grow a bit more. It was fun making the bread and trying to improve on each loaf as I created it. More to come here, I’m sure.</p>

<p>I started watching the talks from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGuKhcnrqGA&amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY">React.js Conf 2016</a> this weekend and am pretty excited about the upcoming possibilities with React. I am especially excited about the “learn once, write anywhere” ideas behind the framework as it grows beyond just the web browser.</p>

<p>Finally, we trekked into the city today to visit friends in the hospital that just had a baby. It was fun to be back at the same hospital where Ken was born and think back to when we started our life with him.</p>

    <p>Kenneth is growing up! He’s about 14 months old and walking all over the apartment. He loves playing with magnets, balls and all my electronics. He is so much fun to be with, but it’s also nice that he still naps twice a day.</p>

<p>Here are a few pictures I’ve taken of him over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>We have reached the halfway point in our Northeast vacation. After spending a couple days in Boston, we made it to Maine to meet up with family and friends. We are staying right on the water and spectacular views out every window.</p>

<p>The water is too cold to swim in, but loads of fun boat and kayak. We’ve taken a couple trips out on the water, with an excursion over to Russ Island for some hiking and a packed lunch. This was Kenneth’s first time out in a boat and while he didn’t love it, he did a great job.<br></p>

<p>Yesterday we took a trip to Acadia National Park. The weather was nearly perfect from the top and we had great views of Bar Harbor and the surrounding area. Kenneth didn’t like the wind, so he had to spend some time in the car, but everyone else enjoyed the national park.<br></p>

<p>After coming down Cadillac Mountain, we headed for Bar Harbor and spent a couple more hours in the sun and sea breeze. Rachel, Kenneth and I found some shade by the water and took a nap while everyone else shopped around town.</p>

<p>Most importantly, Kenneth has gotten to spend a lot of time with his grandparents - they know just how to make him squeal with excitement.</p>

<p>Crusher was in such a playful mood last Saturday. He was running all over the apartment and even trying to play with Kenneth some. He caught his breath just long enough for me to capture this shot then he was off again.</p>

<p>Kenneth got to talk to his grandparents tonight on FaceTime. He showed off his ability to sit all on his own and a few other tricks. When they make big movements, he’s able to see them and pays attention for a few seconds. It’s great having technology that keeps us connected even when we are thousands of miles apart.</p>

<p>Rachel's parents came out to visit us for the week. We had a great time together and Kenneth loved them holding him. My parents are coming to see us next week.</p>

<p><span>Kenneth rushed into our lives on January 8th. Rachel woke up early with contractions, but by the time I needed to get ready for work, she didn't expect the baby to come any time that day so I went on my way. By two in the afternoon her contractions were coming every couple minutes and she told me to come home, she thought the baby was probably on his way.</span></p>
<p>We left for the hospital by three and made it by four. By 4:25 Rachel was in a delivery room with doctors telling her to push. All those breathing exercises and early laboring techniques we learned in our classes were thrown out the window, we got to the hospital just in time for her to push the baby out. I was quite nervous because she was in so much pain, but the doctors were beyond impressed with her because she was so strong  in making it to this point on her own. I was and still am so proud of her.</p>
<p>After some intense pushing on Rachel's part, we got to meet Kenneth. He was born at 6:41 pm and was so unbelievably cute. He was so happy to be hugging Rachel and she was just as happy to be hugging him right back.</p>
<p>Rachel and Kenneth stayed at the hospital for a couple days and then on Saturday I got to drive them home.</p>

<p><span>Kenneth has been home with us for one week and is the perfect baby already. I love holding him, watching him make funny faces and listen to his adorable sounds. All he really does at this point is eat and sleep, but it is still so great to be with him.</span></p>
<p><span>This is no surprise to me, but Rachel is an amazing mom to Ken. Leading up to his birth, she prepared in every way possible for Ken. She is so loving toward him and he is such a happy baby in her arms. </span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span>It's taken Rachel and me a long time to get to this point in our lives, but I am very excited for everything that lies ahead.</span></p>

    <p>I was fortunate to attend a friend's bachelor party at Yankee Stadium and even though the Yankees lost, it was still a fun way to send Matt off. For the game we had a suite on the first base with more than enough room and food for us.</p>
<p>We got the stadium around noon and settled in.</p>
<p><img alt="image" src="/images/8fd21b1900b0869c0ec0cb8ca791a56756d8b291e9e5075554080badd204a1a1.jpg"></p>

<p>Around the start of the game, a couple of Yankees historians game by to show and let us hold a few historical objects. We got to see a game-worn jersey from Jeter's 3,000th hit game (apparently he quite a few that day), home plate from the last game at the old stadium and first at the new one, a bat signed and used by Mickey Mantle in the 1958 World Series, and a couple recent World Series rings.</p>

<p>The game, itself, didn't go to well for the Yankees, but I still had a great time.</p>
