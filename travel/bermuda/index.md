### Bus
[Routes and maps](https://www.gov.bm/bus-routes-and-maps)  
*I can't actually find the maps, but it looks like route 10 and 11 will go between our hotels (more or less) and probably take about 40 minutes. A "booklet of 15" (rides?) costs $37.50 and these rides are good on both the bus and ferry. We should count up our proposed rides, but getting one booklet seems like a no-brainer*

Nearby at the historic Clocktower Mall, you can shop local boutiques for jewellery, swimwear, handicrafts and more.

Inside, you’ll see gold bars, jewellery and other treasures recovered from centuries-old shipwrecks by scuba diving archaeologists, or learn about the more than 90 forts around Bermuda in the Defence Heritage exhibit. And kids can crawl through a lighthouse and giant moray eel at the Museum Playground & Playhouse

*There is a special exhibit on the U 505 captured by the US Navy during WWII that I would like to see because my grandfather was stationed in Bermuda and worked on the submarine when into the Dockyard.*

> This small exhibit in the US Navy Room tells the remarkable story of the capture of the German U-505 submarine off the west coast of Africa, and its concealment in Bermuda while Allied strategists and codebreakers took advantage of the captured Enigma machine and codebook.
