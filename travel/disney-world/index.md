We are planning a trip to Walt Disney World in Orlando to celebrate Ken's second birthday. This will be his first time to Disney World, but third trip to a Disney theme park. He's already been to both Disneyland and Disneyland Paris.

Disney makes it easy to plan, but here's a few other details to help manage the trip.

# Park Plans

With four day park hopper tickets we plan to make the most of our time with a park in the morning, back to the hotel for a nap and then back at it in the evening.

## Thursday, February 9th

The plan for Thursday is to spend the whole day in Magic Kingdom. Our hotel is close and easy to get to, so we'll take a mid-day break for his nap after lunch.
