        <title>Bread Success</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I don’t plan to post everytime I bake bread, but Rachel and I have further refined our recipe and had a near-perfect raisin walnut sourdough bread this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160312_DSC_1869.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;raisin walnut sourdough&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I added an extra 75 grams of flour, 575g total, and cooked the bread for an hour at 450 degrees. The key we found with our oven is to put a baking sheet under the dutch oven to prevent the bottom of the bread from burning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bread fresh out of the oven makes for a pretty awesome breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Sourdough Bread Notes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/02/28/weekend-update&quot;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; that I started baking my own sourdough bread from my own starter. I’ve now been at it for two weeks and think the bread is really starting to come along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I prepared the dough for a basic sourdough bread, based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theclevercarrot.com/2014/01/sourdough-bread-a-beginners-guide/&quot;&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt;. I put in a bit more flour than the recipe called for because of a previous trial with the recipe and think it was about right, but will maybe do a bit less next time. Given that it’s winter and a bit colder, I let bulk fermentation go for about 14 hours. I then split the dough in half and baked the first loaf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160307_DSC_1824.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;first loaf&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160307_DSC_1828.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;first loaf cut&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first loaf baked in the dutch oven with the lid on for 60 minutes. Since our oven has been burning the bread, I set the oven to about 410°F and the temperature seemed about right this time. It still came out a bit overdone on the outside and maybe a touch underdone inside. The sourdough flavor is starting to show in these latest loaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160307_DSC_1825.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;second loaf&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second loaf got an extra hour for the second rise and I baked it for only 50 minutes and came out looking perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First run after my right knee injury so I took it easy for the first two miles. At that point, I changed the pace up to a tempo run to see how things felt. I actually felt better at the faster speed. Overall, my knee does not feel as healed as I would like. I am not experiencing any pain, but it feels a bit more sore than ideal. I plan to rest tomorrow and see how things feel this weekend for a five to eight mile run.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth and I got to spend more quality time together this weekend. We took Crusher for a couple walks and inspected the bark of nearly every tree along the way. Crusher does not mind the slowness involved with bark inspection since he’s usually on the hunt for the next smell to track down. The weather was really nice this weekend, so I didn’t mind the slow stroll with the boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When inside, we played a lot of music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160228_IMG_8764.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ken with his microphone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel and I recently watched Cooked, the documentary based on the book by Michael Pollan. It was a great series and I was especially drawn to the part where he makes his own bread. We looked up a few recipes and started making our own sourdough starter last weekend and this weekend got to start making the bread. The loaves turned out well enough that they could pass for bread, but not quite sourdough. I think the starter has to grow a bit more. It was fun making the bread and trying to improve on each loaf as I created it. More to come here, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started watching the talks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGuKhcnrqGA&amp;amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY&quot;&gt;React.js Conf 2016&lt;/a&gt; this weekend and am pretty excited about the upcoming possibilities with React. I am especially excited about the “learn once, write anywhere” ideas behind the framework as it grows beyond just the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we trekked into the city today to visit friends in the hospital that just had a baby. It was fun to be back at the same hospital where Ken was born and think back to when we started our life with him.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kenneth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth is growing up! He’s about 14 months old and walking all over the apartment. He loves playing with magnets, balls and all my electronics. He is so much fun to be with, but it’s also nice that he still naps twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pictures I’ve taken of him over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first run back after experiencing knee pain nearly two weeks prior. This also happened to be the Al Gordon 4M race in Prospect Park. I decided I needed to test my knee because it had improved over the last week and a half. This was a bit of a mistake and I ended up in more pain after that I when I began. I felt different parts of my leg in pain at different parts of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I tried to take it really easy, but still ended up doing more damage. The pain returned to the outside of my right knee, which was mostly felt going up and down stairs. I got a massage the next day and felt dramatically better, but still felt minor soreness and fatigue for over a week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was feel really good on this run, but I must have overdid it. Everything felt strong until I reach the six mile mark and my knee started feeling terrible. My IT Band seemed to be moving all over the place and when I made it home and walked up the stairs, I could tell I was in trouble due to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried resting for nearly two weeks and was still not any better.&lt;/p&gt;
