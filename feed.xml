        <title>Weekend Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth and I got to spend more quality time together this weekend. We took Crusher for a couple walks and inspected the bark of nearly every tree along the way. Crusher does not mind the slowness involved with bark inspection since he’s usually on the hunt for the next smell to track down. The weather was really nice this weekend, so I didn’t mind the slow stroll with the boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When inside, we played a lot of music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160228_IMG_8764.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ken with his microphone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel and I recently watched Cooked, the documentary based on the book by Michael Pollan. It was a great series and I was especially drawn to the part where he makes his own bread. We looked up a few recipes and started making our own sourdough starter last weekend and this weekend got to start making the bread. The loafs turned out well enough that they could pass for bread, but not quite sourdough. I think the start has to grow a bit more. It was fun making the bread and trying to improve on each loaf as I created it. More to come here, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started watching the talks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGuKhcnrqGA&amp;amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY&quot;&gt;React.js Conf 2016&lt;/a&gt; this weekend and am pretty excited about the upcoming possibilities with React. I am especially excited about the “learn once, write anywhere” ideas behind the framework as it grows beyond just the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we trekked into the city today to visit friends in the hospital that just had a baby. It was fun to be back at the same hospital where Ken was born and think back to when we started our life with him.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kenneth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth is growing up! He’s about 14 months old and walking all over the apartment. He loves playing with magnets, balls and all my electronics. He is so much fun to be with, but it’s also nice that he still naps twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pictures I’ve taken of him over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first run back after experiencing knee pain nearly two weeks prior. This also happened to be the Al Gordon 4M race in Prospect Park. I decided I needed to test my knee because it had improved over the last week and a half. This was a bit of a mistake and I ended up in more pain after that I when I began. I felt different parts of my leg in pain at different parts of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I tried to take it really easy, but still ended up doing more damage. The pain returned to the outside of my right knee, which was mostly felt going up and down stairs. I got a massage the next day and felt dramatically better, but still felt minor soreness and fatigue for over a week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was feel really good on this run, but I must have overdid it. Everything felt strong until I reach the six mile mark and my knee started feeling terrible. My IT Band seemed to be moving all over the place and when I made it home and walked up the stairs, I could tell I was in trouble due to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried resting for nearly two weeks and was still not any better.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vacation</title>
        <description>&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/39c9fa5f73fa7f63046023b02cf4df7358084e77fd5a8d31afd10af33e00e5e9.jpg&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have reached the halfway point in our Northeast vacation. After spending a couple days in Boston, we made it to Maine to meet up with family and friends. We are staying right on the water and spectacular views out every window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/65611c31a62a13b491804f8ebcc4c4bbbda1ef6afaac6cb39235c46b6e88b3ad.jpg&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The water is too cold to swim in, but loads of fun boat and kayak. We’ve taken a couple trips out on the water, with an excursion over to Russ Island for some hiking and a packed lunch. This was Kenneth’s first time out in a boat and while he didn’t love it, he did a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/92130f841d12fe0a92f316b3838a29a8b0d06e4da44251ed59227dcd03875e63.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;6000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;4000&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/64a9db0a8464fd07c97a219fe74cd2b03814846b541ff0bbe3cd74c44d9ddd2a.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;6000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;4000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday we took a trip to Acadia National Park. The weather was nearly perfect from the top and we had great views of Bar Harbor and the surrounding area. Kenneth didn’t like the wind, so he had to spend some time in the car, but everyone else enjoyed the national park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/b62e912a3f3bc615aaacb4c5820805fd9ca55534f728696b22261e4c4bf2a465.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/33fde235c8e37f829d5ed96d0a7b0b759651519290d078d0c9fc62e9b348d007.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After coming down Cadillac Mountain, we headed for Bar Harbor and spent a couple more hours in the sun and sea breeze. Rachel, Kenneth and I found some shade by the water and took a nap while everyone else shopped around town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;tmblr-full&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/63cf82bbd4131cc19d59309100c5c03a4ecf89da5066976d02c50e2bcd08c242.jpg&quot; data-orig-height=&quot;4000&quot; data-orig-width=&quot;6000&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Kenneth has gotten to spend a lot of time with his grandparents - they know just how to make him squeal with excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve started our Northeast vacation. We are spending a couple days in Boston and then heading to Stonington, ME to meet up with family and friends.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan on spending the afternoon at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and catching the Astros vs. Red Sox game at Fenway Park tonight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crusher was in such a playful mood last Saturday. He was running all over the apartment and even trying to play with Kenneth some. He caught his breath just long enough for me to capture this shot then he was off again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He loves standing and is always so proud when he is able to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clouds over Lower Manhattan. There is always a great view when running over the Brooklyn Bridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth got to talk to his grandparents tonight on FaceTime. He showed off his ability to sit all on his own and a few other tricks. When they make big movements, he’s able to see them and pays attention for a few seconds. It’s great having technology that keeps us connected even when we are thousands of miles apart.&lt;/p&gt;
