        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;First run after my right knee injury so I took it easy for the first two miles. At that point, I changed the pace up to a tempo run to see how things felt. I actually felt better at the faster speed. Overall, my knee does not feel as healed as I would like. I am not experiencing any pain, but it feels a bit more sore than ideal. I plan to rest tomorrow and see how things feel this weekend for a five to eight mile run.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Weekend Update</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth and I got to spend more quality time together this weekend. We took Crusher for a couple walks and inspected the bark of nearly every tree along the way. Crusher does not mind the slowness involved with bark inspection since he’s usually on the hunt for the next smell to track down. The weather was really nice this weekend, so I didn’t mind the slow stroll with the boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When inside, we played a lot of music!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20160228_IMG_8764.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;ken with his microphone&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rachel and I recently watched Cooked, the documentary based on the book by Michael Pollan. It was a great series and I was especially drawn to the part where he makes his own bread. We looked up a few recipes and started making our own sourdough starter last weekend and this weekend got to start making the bread. The loaves turned out well enough that they could pass for bread, but not quite sourdough. I think the start has to grow a bit more. It was fun making the bread and trying to improve on each loaf as I created it. More to come here, I’m sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started watching the talks from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGuKhcnrqGA&amp;amp;list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY&quot;&gt;React.js Conf 2016&lt;/a&gt; this weekend and am pretty excited about the upcoming possibilities with React. I am especially excited about the “learn once, write anywhere” ideas behind the framework as it grows beyond just the web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we trekked into the city today to visit friends in the hospital that just had a baby. It was fun to be back at the same hospital where Ken was born and think back to when we started our life with him.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Kenneth</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Kenneth is growing up! He’s about 14 months old and walking all over the apartment. He loves playing with magnets, balls and all my electronics. He is so much fun to be with, but it’s also nice that he still naps twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few pictures I’ve taken of him over the last few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my first run back after experiencing knee pain nearly two weeks prior. This also happened to be the Al Gordon 4M race in Prospect Park. I decided I needed to test my knee because it had improved over the last week and a half. This was a bit of a mistake and I ended up in more pain after that I when I began. I felt different parts of my leg in pain at different parts of the race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I tried to take it really easy, but still ended up doing more damage. The pain returned to the outside of my right knee, which was mostly felt going up and down stairs. I got a massage the next day and felt dramatically better, but still felt minor soreness and fatigue for over a week.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Morning Run</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was feel really good on this run, but I must have overdid it. Everything felt strong until I reach the six mile mark and my knee started feeling terrible. My IT Band seemed to be moving all over the place and when I made it home and walked up the stairs, I could tell I was in trouble due to the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried resting for nearly two weeks and was still not any better.&lt;/p&gt;
